## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tutorspet/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tutorspet/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-student 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tutorspet/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel
`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
 are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tutorspet/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml
 `](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic Component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorspet/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TutorsPetParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in the instantiation of a `Command` object which is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-student 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-student 1` Command](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model Component

This section explains the high level design of the `Model` component of the application.

The `Model` component manages the data stored in the application during runtime.

The `Model` stores:
* a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* a `VersionedTutorsPet` object that contains Tutor's Pet data.

There are four packages in the component, each representing a corresponding 'physical' entity:
* The `Student` package contains classes that represent a student.
* The `ModuleClass` package contains classes that represent a class (a group of students that attend the same lessons).<br/>
  *The package name `ModuleClass` was chosen as `class` is a reserved keyword in Java.*
* The `Lesson` package contains classes that represent a series of lessons.
* The `Attendance` package contains classes that represent the attendance and participation records of students.

It also exposes two unmodifiable `ObservableList<>`, one each for `Student` and `ModuleClass`, that can be 'observed'.
This allows the UI component to automatically update when the data in these lists change.

The class diagram below gives an overview of the model package.<br/>
*Details of the `Student`, `ModuleClass`, `Lesson`, and `Attendance` packages have be omitted for brevity.
 Please refer to the [Student & ModuleClass](#structure-of-student-class-model), [Lesson](#lesson-class-diagram) and [Attendance](#attendance-class-diagram) diagrams for more information.*

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorspet/model/Model.java)

<a name="structure-of-student-class-model"/>

The class diagram below shows the design of the `Student` and `ModuleClass` packages.

![Structure of Student Class Model](images/ClassStudentClassDiagram.png)

### Storage Component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tutorspet/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the data in json format and read it back.

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tutorspet.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Student Model and Student Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)

A `UUID` is a unique 128-bit number to identify a unique `Student` within Tutor’s Pet.
In Tutor’s Pet, every `Student` upon construction is assigned a randomly generated `UUID` that is used to
uniquely identify a `Student` across `Classes` and `Lessons`. This is important because we are dealing with
`Student` data not just in the `Student` model itself, but also `Classes` and `Lessons`. Using a
`Student` `UUID` will help to ensure referential integrity of `Student` data across different models when
`Student` data is modified by the user.

#### Implementation

The class diagram below shows the current implementation of `Student` model.

![Student Model](images/StudentModelClassDiagram.png)

Every `Student` contains a `UUID`, `Name`, `Telegram`, `Email`, and a set of `Tags`.

![StudentUUID](images/StudentUUID.png)

From the object diagram above, we have designed the `Student` model such that every `Student` like `Alice`
has a unique 128 bit `UUID` tagged to him/her, in addition to the `Name`, `Telegram`, `Email`, and `Tags`
fields providing information of the `Student`.

#### Design Considerations

This section elaborates further on the reason why we eventually chose to adopt a `UUID` over other potential
solutions.

##### Aspect 1: How to uniquely identify Students across models.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Assign a `UUID` tag to each `Student`
  * Pros:
    * Convenient to generate `UUID` in Java as Java has a `UUID` package to support `UUID`s.
    * `UUID` is non-editable.
  * Cons:
    * Implementation is slightly more complicated as caution must be taken in integrating the `UUID` field into
      `Student` model, and enforce `Student` equality checks using `UUID` in Tutor’s Pet.
    * Although the chances are low, it is possible that generating random `UUID`s present a risk of `UUID` collisions
      when we deal with large amounts of student data.

* **Alternative 2:** Enforce that each `Student` must have a unique `Email`
  * Pros:
    * Easier to implement as the original AB3 already has an `Email` field integrated into it.
  * Cons:
    * The `Email` field is editable while the unique identifier of each `Student` should not be editable to prevent
      the need to cascade a change in the identifier of the `Student`.

### ModuleClass Model
This section explains the design considerations of the `ModuleClass` model.

#### Implementation
The class diagram below shows the current implementation of `ModuleClass` model.

![ModuleClass Model](images/ModuleClassModelClassDiagram.png)

A `ModuleClass` contains a `Name`, and also a set of `studentUuids` that is enrolled in the class.
A `ModuleClass` can also contain any number of `Lesson` objects.

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect 1: Student storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores `Student` `UUID` object in `ModuleClass` as a Set.
  This implementation ensures that there are no duplicate students found in a class.
  * Pros:
    * Ensures that all students within a class are unique.
  * Cons:
    * There is a possibility of UUID collision, even though the probability is very low.

* **Alternative 2:** Stores `Student` object in `ModuleClass`.
   * Pros:
     * Easy to implement.
   * Cons:
     * Difficult to check for duplicate students when adding or editing students in classes.

### Lesson Model
This section explains the design considerations of the `Lesson` model.

#### Implementation

<a name="lesson-class-diagram"/>

The class diagram below shows the current implementation of `Lesson` model.

![Lesson Model](images/LessonModelClassDiagram.png)

Every `Lesson` contains `startTime`, `endTime`, `Day`, `NumberOfOccurrences`, `Venue` and `AttendanceRecordList`.
The `NumberOfOccurrences` represents the number of weeks the lesson last and the `AttendanceRecordList` stores the
attendance of students. The implementation of `Attendance` model is explained in the next section.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source:
**Note:** All classes in the `Lesson` package are designed to be immutable.
</div>

A `ModuleClass` can contain any number of `Lesson` objects, but cannot contain duplicate `Lesson`s or `Lesson`s
with overlapping time.
`Lesson`s are considered duplicate if they have the same start time, end time and day.<br>

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` when a `Lesson` is added to `ModuleClass`.
The utility methods for modifying `Lesson` in `ModuleClass` are in `ModuleClassUtil` to avoid handling add, edit and
delete in the `Model` component.

![Add Lesson Sequence Diagram](images/AddLessonSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddLessonCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a
limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

1. The `AddLessonCommand` execution will call static methods from `ModuleClassUtil`.

1. `ModuleClassUtil` will check whether `lessonToAdd` already exists in `targetModuleClass` by calling
   `hasLesson(lessonToAdd)`. For each `Lesson` in the `targetModuleClass`, this method will call `Lesson#isSameLesson(lessonToAdd)`.
   (This part is omitted from diagram for brevity)

1. It will also check whether there is a `Lesson` with overlapping time in `targetModuleClass` by calling `hasOverlapLesson(lessonToAdd)`,
   which then calls `Lesson#isOverlapLesson(lesson)`. (The latter part is omitted from diagram for brevity)

1. If `lessonToAdd` does not exists in `targetModuleClass` and the timing does not overlap with any existing `Lesson`s, a new
   `ModuleClass` with `lessonToAdd` will be created. Otherwise, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect 1: Maintaining immutability
A new `Lesson` object will be created whenever there is a change to any of the attributes. This is to guarantee
the immutability of `Lesson`.

##### Aspect 2: Uniqueness of `Lesson`

Two possible implementations were considered.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores `Lesson` object in `ModuleClass`

  This implementation allows duplicate lessons in different classes.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement.
  * Cons:
    * Difficult to check for duplicate lessons when adding or editing lessons as we will need to iterate through all
      classes.

* **Alternative 2:** Have UUID field for `Lesson` and `ModuleClass` stores UUID

  This is similar to how `Student` is implemented. It would be a better alternative if we want all lessons to be unique
  as we can have a `UniqueLessonList` to store all lessons as shown below.

  ![Lesson Model](images/UniqueLessonListClassDiagram.png)

  * Pros:
    * Easy to check for duplicate lessons in different classes.
  * Cons:
    * There is a possibility of UUID collision, even though the probability is very low.
    * Harder to implement.

Alternative 1 was chosen because it is possible to have the same lesson in different classes if users do not delete
the data for previous semesters. Hence, we want to allow duplicate lessons only in different classes. Furthermore,
since users need to specify the class index when editing or deleting lessons, it makes alternative 1 easier to implement.

### Attendance Model
This section explains the design considerations of the `Attendance` model.

#### Implementation
The `Attendance`, `AttendanceRecord` and `AttendanceRecordList` models are implemented as follows:

<a name="attendance-class-diagram"/>

![AttendanceClassDiagram](images/AttendanceClassDiagram.png)

`Attendance` encapsulates the information of a particular student's attendance in a specific lesson he/she has attended.
`AttendanceRecord` refers to the actual attendance roster of a particular lesson event.
It contains the `Attendance`s of all `Student`s who have attended the particular lesson.
These information are stored as a `Map` with `Student` `UUID` as keys.
`AttendanceRecordList` refers to the list of all `AttendanceRecord` instances.
The size of this list is fixed and is determined by the `NumberOfOccurences` in `Lesson`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source:
**Note:** All classes in the `Attendance` package are designed to be immutable.
</div>

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect 1: Reducing user input
Users should not have to type in attendance-related commands when the student is absent from a lesson.
Therefore, the `Attendance` class does not have, for example, a `boolean hasAttended` attribute.
It only has a `participationScore` attribute.

##### Aspect 2: Maintaining immutability and optimising `AttendanceRecord`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Dynamically updating `AttendanceRecord` whenever there is a change to attendance.
  * Pros:
    * Guarantees immutability.
  * Cons:
    * Requires re-instantiation of a `Map` object whenever a user adds/edits/deletes an `Attendance`.

* **Alternative 2:** Initialising empty `Attendance` instances for all students on call to constructor method. \
This would mean each `Attendance` is set to a particular value, whenever there is a change to an `AttendanceRecord`.
  * Pros:
    * Less overhead in modifying `Attendance`.
  * Cons:
    * Violates immutability.
    * Incurs greater memory use.

Alternative 1 was chosen as we prioritized immutability.
The main benefit of Alternative 2 is that the entire `Map` object need not be copied every time everytime a user adds/edits/deletes an `Attendance`.
However, this would violate immutability of the `Attendance` package.
So, we have decided to implement Alternative 1.

##### Aspect 3: Handling of invalid `Week` number
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store `AttendanceRecord`s in a fixed size `List`.
  * Pros:
    * Handles exceptions easily when a user inputs a week number greater than the total number of lessons.
    * Provides constant time access as the week number is used as an index to the `List`.
    * Easier to iterate over for `StatisticsCommand`.
  * Cons:
    * Requires additional methods to ensure the size of the `List` is fixed.

* **Alternative 2:** Store a `Map` of `Week` number to `AttendanceRecord`.
  * Pros:
    * Incurs less memory use.
  * Cons:
    * More difficult to iterate over for `StatisticsCommand`.
    * More difficult to implement as each `Week` number must be checked to ensure it does not exceed `NumberOfOccurrences` in `Lesson`.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it was easier to check for invalid week numbers.
To check for invalid week numbers in Alternative 2, additional checks have to be done within the `AttendanceRecordList` class to ensure the week numbers do not exceed the `NumberOfOccurrences`.

The sequence diagram below shows how an `Attendance` instance is retrieved.

![AttendanceRetrievalSequenceDiagram](images/AttendanceRetrievalSequenceDiagram.png)

To avoid implementing add, edit and delete methods in the `Attendance` package, we created utility classes instead to handle these operations.
These utility classes are `ModuleClassUtil`, `LessonUtil` and `AttendanceRecordListUtil`.

### Display Statistics Feature
The display statistics feature allows users to view a student's average class participation score as well as
lesson attendances.

This section explains the implementation of the display statistics mechanism and highlights the design considerations
taken into account when implementing this feature.

#### Implementation

The display statistics mechanism is facilitated by `StatisticsCommand`. It extends `Command`.

* `DisplayStatisticsCommand#execute()`: Performs a validity check and returns a specific student's statistics if all
 validations passed.

The following class diagram shows the relationship between classes during the execution of a `StatisticsCommand`:

![StatisticsClassDiagram](images/StatisticsClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions within the `Logic` component during the execution
of a `StatisticsCommand` with user input `stats c\1 s\1`:

![StatisticsSequenceDiagram](images/StatisticsSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `Logic` uses the `TutorsPetParser` class to parse the user command.
1. A new instance of a `StatisticsCommand` object would be created by the `StatisticsCommandParser` and returns to
   `TutorsPetParser`.
1. `TutorsPetParser` encapsulates the `StatisticsCommand` object as a `Command` object which is executed by
   the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution calls static methods from the `ModuleClassUtil` and `LessonUtil` classes.
1. As seen above, `ModuleClassUtil` then iterates through the list of lessons to calculate the student's participation
   score and absent weeks by using `LessonUtil#getParticipationScoreFromLesson(lesson, student)` and
   `LessonUtil#getAbsentWeekFromLesson(lesson, student)` respectively.
1. `StatisticsCommand` then encapsulates the result into a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect 1: How statistics feature executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extract the methods out to another class
(`ModuleClassUtil` and `LessonClassUtil`).
  * Pros:
    * Does not violate the law of demeter. Increases cohesion and thus increase maintainability and testability.
  * Cons:
    * Requires more wrapper methods to carry information.
    * More effort to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Obtain all attendance information within `StatisticsCommand#execute()`.
  * Pros:
    * Easy, straightforward to implement.
  * Cons:
    * Violates the law of demeter to a large extent.

Alternative 1 was chosen to maintain the testability of our code. In addition, abstracting out the
methods helps to increase reusability of the code. This provides `StatisticsCommand#execute()` the ability to compute
the relevant results without knowing the low level implementations.

##### Aspect 2: Responsibility of relevant methods

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow `ModuleClassUtil#getParticipationScore` and
`ModuleClassUtil#getAbsentWeek` to return intermediate values.
  * Pros:
    * Reduce the responsibilities of `ModuleClassUtil#getParticipationScore` and `ModuleClassUtil#getAbsentWeek`.
  * Cons:
    * Additional processing required to process the results of the method calls in `StatisticsCommand#execute()`.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow `ModuleClassUtil#getParticipationScore` and
`ModuleClassUtil#getAbsentWeek` to return a `String` representation directly.
  * Pros:
    * Easy, straightforward to implement.
    * Do not need to iterate through scores and weeks in `StatisticsCommand`.
  * Cons:
    * `ModuleClassUtil#getParticipationScore` and `ModuleClassUtil#getAbsentWeek` would have too many
       responsibilities. Violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

### Add Attendance Feature
The add attendance feature allows users to record a student's attendance and participation score for a specific
week's lesson.

This section explains the implementation of the add attendance mechanism and highlights the design considerations
taken into account when implementing this feature.

#### Implementation
The add attendance mechanism is facilitated by `AddAttendanceCommand`. It extends `Command`.

* `AddAttendanceCommand#execute()`: Performs a validity check and adds a student's attendance for a particular week's
  lesson if all validations passed.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between the `Model` and `Logic` components during the execution
of an `AddAttendanceCommand` with user input `add-attendance c\1 l\1 s\1`:

![AddAttendanceSequenceDiagram](images/AddAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `Logic` uses the `TutorsPetParser` class to parse the user command.
1. A new instance of an `AddAttendanceCommand` object would be created by the `AddAttendanceCommandParser` and returned
   to `TutorsPetParser`.
1. `TutorsPetParser` encapsulates the `AddAttendanceCommand` object as a `Command` object which is executed by
   the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution calls `getFilteredStudentList` and `getFilteredModuleClassList` to get the `targetStudent` and
   `targetModuleClass` respectively using indexes from the user input.
1. As seen from the diagram above, `ModuleClassUtil#addAttendanceToModuleClass()` is then called. Execution of that
   method returns a new `ModuleClass` object with the new attendance of the `targetStudent` added.
1. The `targetModuleClass` in the `model` is then updated with the new `ModuleClass` object.
1. The change resulting from the command's execution is saved using the `commit(...)` method for the `undo`/`redo` feature.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

The following activity diagram shows how the `add attendance` operation works.

![AddAttendanceActivityDiagram](images/AddAttendanceActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect 1: How `add attendance` feature executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can only add one attendance at a time.

  * Pros:
    * Less complex code reduces the possibility of bugs.
  * Cons:
    * Less convenient for users as they would have to add attendances for the whole class one at a time.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** Users can make use of the recall feature to speed up the recording of attendances.
</div>

* **Alternative 2:** User can add multiple students' attendances for a specific week's lesson at the same time.

  * Pros:
    * Provides greater convenience for users as they can add attendances for the whole class in a single command.
    * Greater flexibility as users can choose whether to key in attendance one at a time or all at once.
  * Cons:
    * More complex code leading to higher possibility of bugs.

**Justification**

Alternative 1 was chosen because the cons of implementing alternative 2 outweighs the benefits derived from it. It is
unlikely for multiple students to have the same participation score and hence the use of this command with multiple
students is likely to be low. In addition, users can make use of the `recall` feature to speed up the process of
recording attendances.

### Undo/Redo Feature

The undo/redo feature allows users to revert wrongly executed commands.

This section explains the implementation of the Undo and Redo mechanism and highlights the design considerations taken into account when implementing this feature.

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is designed around maintaining a history of Tutor's Pet states, and restoring a particular state when the user triggers an undo or redo command.

The undo and redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTutorsPet`. It extends `TutorsPet` with a history of Tutor's Pet states,
stored internally as a list of `TutorsPetState`. It also maintains a `statePointer` to keep track of the undo/redo history.

A `TutorsPetState` object contains a Tutor's Pet state, represented as a `ReadOnlyTutorsPet`, along with a message that describes the changes relevant to this state.

The class diagram below summarizes the relationships between the key classes used for the undo/redo feature: 

![TutorsPetState](images/TutorsPetState.png)

Additionally, `VersionedTutorsPet` implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTutorsPet#commit(String commitMessage)` – Saves the current Tutor's Pet state, along with the corresponding commit message, in its history.
* `VersionedTutorsPet#undo()` – Restores the previous Tutor's Pet state from its history.
* `VersionedTutorsPet#redo()` – Restores a previously undone Tutor's Pet state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTutorsPet` will be initialized with the initial Tutor's Pet state.
   This initial state will be saved into the `tutorsPetStateList`, and the `statePointer` will point to this initial `TutorsPetState`.

   ![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

2. The user executes `delete-student 5` command to delete the 5th student in Tutor's Pet.
   The `delete-student` command calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)` after it has deleted the student.
   This causes the modified state of Tutor's Pet, after the `delete-student 5` command has executed, to be saved in the `tutorsPetStateList`.
   The `statePointer` will be updated to point to the newly inserted `TutorsPetState`.

   ![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

3. The user executes `add-student n/David …` to add a new student.
   The `add-student` command also calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)` after it has added the new student.
   This causes another modified Tutor's Pet state to be saved into the `tutorsPetStateList`.

   ![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
    :information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`.
    This prevents an erroneous duplicate state to be saved into `tutorsPetStateList`.
    </div>

4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
   The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which shifts the `statePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous state, and restores Tutor's Pet to that state.

   ![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
    :information_source: **Note:** If the `statePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Tutor's Pet state, then there are no previous Tutor's Pet states to restore.
    The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case.
    If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.
    </div>

5. The user decides to execute the command `list`.
   Commands that do not modify the contents of Tutor's Pet, such as `list`, do not call `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`,
   `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `tutorsPetStateList` remains unchanged.

   ![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

6. The user then executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`.
   Since the `statePointer` is not pointing to the last entry of `tutorsPetStateList`, all Tutor's Pet states after the `statePointer` will be purged.
   The new Tutor's Pet state, after the `clear` command has executed, will be saved into the `tutorsPetStateList`.

   Future states after the `statePointer` are purged when saving a new state to maintain a linear history of revertible commands.
   This is the behaviour that most modern desktop applications follow.

   ![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `statePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores Tutor's Pet to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `statePointer` is at index `tutorsPetStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Tutor's Pet state, then there are no undone Tutor's Pet states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect 1: How undo & redo executes

Two possible implementations the undo/redo mechanism were considered.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save all data stored in Tutor's Pet at a given state.
  * Pros:
    * Easier to implement.
  * Cons:
    * Possible performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Commands are designed such that they can reverse the result of their execution.
  * Pros:
    * Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-student`, save only the student deleted, so that it can be restored when undo is called).
  * Cons:
    * We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

Alternative 1 was chosen due to the limited time that was available for this project. The integrity of data was deemed to be
more important than the performance of the application since the product was designed for single user scenarios and
modern machines should be more than capable of handling the potential performance impact of alternative 1.

In addition, the immutable property of the data within the application made it significantly easier for alternative 1 to be implemented.

##### Aspect 2: Commands to support for undo/redo

A key purpose of the undo/redo feature is to prevent the accidental loss of data due to wrongly executed commands.

As such, it was decided that only commands that alter the data in Tutor's Pet would have their state saved, since commands
that do not alter the data of Tutor's Pet would not have any data that would be irrecoverable from an earlier state.

### Command Recall Feature

The command recall feature reduces the effort required by users when frequently entering similar commands.
It allows users to view and reuse previously entered commands through the <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> keys
when the command box is focused.

This section explains the implementation of the command recall feature and highlights the design considerations taken into
account when implementing this feature.

#### Implementation

The command recall mechanism is designed around maintaining a list of previously executed commands, and traversing this list
when the user requests to recall a previous command.

The command recall mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistory`, which consists of a list of previously executed commands,
stored internally as a list of `String`, and a `pointer` to determine the location of the currently recalled command.
In addition, it also consists of a cache, which is used to store the user's existing input.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The data stored in `CommandHistory` does not persist when the application is exited.

</div>

When the application is started, the `CommandHistory` is initialized with an empty list, and the `pointer` is set to
the size of the list, currently zero. After each successful command has been executed, the user input used to trigger the command
will be appended to the list and the `pointer` will be set to the size of the list (henceforth known as the **default position**).
The cache will also be cleared.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** With this implementation of the default position of the pointer,
if the text contained in the command box is a new user input,
then the `pointer` index is one greater than the last stored command.
This makes it easier to identify when the current text should be cached.

</div>

<br/>

When the user presses the <kbd>↑</kbd> key, a check is performed to determine if there is a next available command to recall.
If there is a previous command available, `CommandHistory` next checks if the `pointer` is currently pointing to an entry in its list.
If the `pointer` is not currently pointing to an entry in the list, i.e. it is in its default position,
the current text in the command box is stored in the cache.

![CommandRecallStoresCache](images/CommandRecallStoresCache.png)

Otherwise, there is no change to the cached value. Subsequently, `CommandHistory` decreases its `pointer` by one,
and the respective `String` in the list is returned. The text in the command box is then set to the returned `String`.

If there are no earlier commands to recall, then there is no change to the text in the command box.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** Any edits made by the user to recalled commands are not stored.

</div>

<br/>

When the user presses the <kbd>↓</kbd> key, a check is performed to determine if there is a next available command to recall.
If there is a next available command, the `pointer` index is increased and the respective `String` in the list is returned.

Otherwise, if there is no available next command, i.e. the pointer index is at the last element in the list, then the cached value (if there is one) is returned instead.

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect 1: Behaviour when returning from most recent recalled command

Two possible behaviours were considered when designing the recall command feature.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Restore any text the user had entered before recalling commands.
  * Pros:
    * The user does not loose any progress to partially typed commands.
  * Cons:
    * Difficult to implement as it introduces the need to conditionally store data.

* **Alternative 2:** Reset the command box to its blank state.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement.
  * Cons:
    * The user looses any partially typed commands.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it followed the behaviour of common tools, such as the unix terminal and Windows Command Prompt,
that our target users were familiar with.
